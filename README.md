# Time-series
A time series is a data set that tracks a sample over time. In particular, a time series allows one to see what factors influence certain variables from period to period. Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security, or economic variable changes over time.

These four components are:
Secular trend, which describe the movement along the term;
Seasonal variations, which represent seasonal changes;
Cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to periodical but not seasonal variations;
Irregular variations, which are other nonrandom sources of variations of series.

What are the advantages of time series?
Time series analysis helps organizations understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time. Using data visualizations, business users can see seasonal trends and dig deeper into why these trends occur. With modern analytics platforms, these visualizations can go far beyond line graphs.

What are 5 uses of time series?
Time series are used in statistics, signal processing, pattern recognition, econometrics, mathematical finance, weather forecasting, earthquake prediction

There are two main goals of time series analysis: identifying the nature of the phenomenon represented by the sequence of observations, and forecasting (predicting future values of the time series variable).

What are limitations of time series?
Time series analysis also suffers from a number of weaknesses, including problems with generalization from a single study, difficulty in obtaining appropriate measures, and problems with accurately identifying the correct model to represent the data.
