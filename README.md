# Time-series
A time series is a data set that tracks a sample over time. In particular, a time series allows one to see what factors influence certain variables from period to period. Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security, or economic variable changes over time.

These four components are:
Secular trend, which describe the movement along the term;
Seasonal variations, which represent seasonal changes;
Cyclical fluctuations, which correspond to periodical but not seasonal variations;
Irregular variations, which are other nonrandom sources of variations of series.
